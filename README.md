# Personal Portfoliosite

## Description

This is my personal portfolio web site, where I present my experience and the projects I have done. 
I am also trying out new technologies and different development approaches while developing this portfolio site.

### Current ideas to be used in the development process:

+ Put education, work experience, projects, and possibly other long strings of text into a JSON file and get that information into the appropriate components.
+ Use [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for development file compression.
+ Use Javascript without React or other front-end libraries
